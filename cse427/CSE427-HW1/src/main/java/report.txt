Write: a one sentence summary of the protein's (known) function.
Based on that, write whether you expect each protein to be similar to the others or not.

MYOD1_HUMAN : transcription of muscle-specific target genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation
TAL1_HUMAN  : genesis of hemopoietic malignancies
MYOD1_MOUSE : promotes transcription of muscle-specific target genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation
MYOD1_CHICK : transcriptional activator that promotes transcription of muscle-specific target genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation
MYODA_XENLA : May act as a transcriptional activator that promotes transcription of muscle-specific target genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation
MYOD1_DANRE	: May act as a transcriptional activator that promotes transcription of muscle-specific target genes and plays a role in muscle differentiation
Q8IU24_BRABE: DNA-Binding / Cell differentiation
MYOD_DROME  : May play an important role in the early development of muscle
LIN32_CAEEL : Essential for the specification of the neuroblast cell fate in the development of peripheral sense organs
SYFM_HUMAN  : responsible for the charging of tRNA(Phe) with phenylalanine in mitochondrial translation

The prefixes of names tell us a lot.
MYOD1_HUMAN / MYOD1_MOUSE / MYOD1_CHICK / MYODA_XENLA / MYOD1_DANRE / MYOD_DROME all seem to work something with muscles.
SYFM_HUMAN / TAL1_HUMAN both have something to do with humans.
TAL1_HUMAN / LIN32_CAEEL might be related to development&aging.
Q8IU24_BRABE / SYFM_HUMAN might be related to DNA, because DNA and RNA are closely related.

How my thoughts changed after seeing result:

I think I got the basic theme correct, my initial deduction wasn't too off.

But there still were some surprises:
- mouse and human having very high score (i mean this is understandable
considering mouse is used for medical testing all the time)
- SYFM_HUMAN having almost no similarity with any other
