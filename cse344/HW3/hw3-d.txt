Q.
The DBMS that we use in this assignment is running somewhere in one of Microsoft's data centers. 
Comment on your experience using this DBMS cloud service. 
What do you think about the idea of offering a DBMS as a service in a public cloud?

A.
I think the experience was great.
I didn't experience any lag (but this could be due to server availability during my worktime).

I don't think a DBMS offered in public cloud could be effective.
At my current understanding, a public cloud isn't efficient or reliable enough to host a DBMS.

Although it would be exciting if everyone could have access to a DBMS,
if a DBMS is possible of data losses, crashes, or quick exhaustion of storage spaces,
I believe that DBMS no longer serves the purpose as a DBMS.
