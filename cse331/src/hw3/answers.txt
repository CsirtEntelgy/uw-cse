Problem 6.

(a) Because the exception is to be thrown when the given integer is
	less than zero, but the if-expression was less than or equal to zero.
	Zero isn't negative but the program was throwing an exception, saying it is.

(b) This error is about testing 0 and 1. Since there was an error for passing zero,
	this error happened. After fixing (a), it was gone. 

(c) The recursive call and the else-if statement was wrong. The else-if statement
	should have been less than or equal to 1, which sets the base case for the
	recursion and is the first two number of Fibonacci numbers. The recursive call
	should have a "+" between, not a "-". It is wrong because it is against the
	definition of Fibonacci numbers. After fixing these the error was gone.


Problem 7. 

(a) The constructor should be assigning volume to this.volume.
	Also the getVolume method always returned 0, not the actual volume.
	
(b) I believe the second approach is better (I did it that way) because it doesn't
	calculate every time getVolume is called, saving runtime and memory.
	
(c) First way to implement getBallsFromSmallest would be moving all the ball elements
	into an array first using the iterator. Then using the getVolume and the sorting
	methods, we can get a sorted array. Moving that array back into a ballContainer
	object and returning it's iterator. Second would be calling a new iterator over
	and over until we completed our sorted set. In each call to the iterator we would
	find the smallest element and remove it from the original ballContainer whilst
	adding it to the temp ballContainer. Repeat this process until the original
	container is empty, return the iterator of the temp container.
	I chose the second method although it may cause much more runtime require much
	more memory, it is more intuitive and easy to follow.
